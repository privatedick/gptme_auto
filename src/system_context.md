# System Design Context and Principles

## System Philosophy
This system is designed to be a robust, secure, and user-friendly toolkit for AI-assisted development. Every component should reflect these core principles:

### Architectural Values
- Safety First: All operations must be non-destructive and recoverable
- Clarity Over Cleverness: Clear, maintainable code is preferred over complex optimizations
- Progressive Disclosure: Simple interface for basic usage, with power features available when needed
- Defensive Programming: Assume inputs may be invalid and handle errors gracefully

### Code Design Principles

#### Component Structure
Every major component should follow this pattern:
```python
class ComponentName:
    """Component purpose and responsibility summary.
    
    This class handles a specific area of functionality and maintains
    clear boundaries with other components. It follows the single
    responsibility principle and uses dependency injection.
    
    Attributes:
        attr_name: Description of what this attribute represents
        other_attr: Description of another attribute
    """
    
    def __init__(self, *dependencies):
        """Initialize with required dependencies.
        
        Args:
            dependencies: Other components this one needs
        """
        self.logger = self._setup_logging()  # Always include logging
        self._validate_dependencies(dependencies)
        self._initialize_state()
    
    def _setup_logging(self) -> logging.Logger:
        """Configure component-specific logging."""
        return get_logger(__name__)

    async def operation(self, input_data: InputType) -> ResultType:
        """Template for typical async operation.
        
        Operations should:
        1. Validate inputs
        2. Log major steps
        3. Handle errors gracefully
        4. Return well-defined types
        """
        try:
            self._validate_input(input_data)
            self.logger.info(f"Starting {operation.__name__}")
            result = await self._perform_operation(input_data)
            self.logger.info(f"Completed {operation.__name__}")
            return result
        except Exception as e:
            self.logger.error(f"Operation failed: {e}")
            raise OperationError(f"Failed to {operation.__name__}: {e}") from e
```

#### Error Handling
Every error case should be handled explicitly:
- Use custom exception classes for different error types
- Include context in error messages
- Log errors with appropriate detail
- Provide recovery paths where possible

#### State Management 
- Prefer immutable state where possible
- Use dataclasses for data containers
- Include validation in state modifications
- Maintain clear state boundaries

#### Asynchronous Operations
- Use async/await consistently
- Handle cancellation gracefully
- Include timeouts where appropriate
- Manage resource cleanup properly

### Code Style Conventions

#### Documentation
Every module must have:
- Module docstring explaining purpose
- Class/function docstrings with:
  - Purpose description
  - Args/returns documentation
  - Usage examples where helpful
  - Notes about side effects
- Inline comments for complex logic

#### Type Annotations
Use comprehensive type hints:
```python
from typing import Optional, List, Dict, Any, TypeVar, Generic

T = TypeVar('T')

class Container(Generic[T]):
    """Example of proper type annotation usage."""
    
    def process(self, items: List[T]) -> Dict[str, Optional[T]]:
        """Process items with clear type specifications."""
```

#### Error Classes
Maintain error hierarchy:
```python
class SystemError(Exception):
    """Base class for system errors."""

class ComponentError(SystemError):
    """Base class for component-specific errors."""

class OperationError(ComponentError):
    """Specific operation failure."""
```

### Integration Patterns

#### Component Communication
Components should:
- Accept dependencies via constructor
- Use abstract base classes/protocols
- Return rich result objects
- Handle partial failures

#### Resource Management
Resources must be:
- Acquired safely
- Released reliably
- Monitored for leaks
- Rate-limited appropriately

### Testing Requirements

Each component requires:
- Unit tests for all public methods
- Integration tests for interactions
- Property-based tests where applicable
- Performance tests for critical paths

### Security Considerations

All code must:
- Validate all inputs
- Sanitize all outputs
- Handle sensitive data carefully
- Maintain access controls

### Performance Guidelines

Optimize for:
- Consistent performance over peak performance
- Memory efficiency
- Resource sharing
- Graceful degradation

## System Context

### Component Relationships
Components interact through:
- Clear interfaces
- Typed messages
- Structured events
- Monitored channels

### State Flow
Data flows through the system:
1. Input validation
2. Processing pipeline
3. Result verification
4. State updates
5. Event notifications

### Error Flow
Errors are handled by:
1. Local recovery
2. Component isolation
3. System fallback
4. User notification

## Implementation Notes

When implementing any part of the system:
1. Start with interface definition
2. Add comprehensive tests
3. Implement core functionality
4. Add error handling
5. Optimize if needed

Each implementation should:
- Follow the patterns above
- Maintain consistency
- Consider extensions
- Document decisions

## Technical Decisions

### Python Version
- Target Python 3.11+
- Use modern language features
- Maintain compatibility
- Document requirements

### Dependencies
- Minimize external dependencies
- Use established libraries
- Pin versions precisely
- Document purpose of each

### Configuration
- Use YAML for configs
- Support environment overrides
- Validate all settings
- Provide defaults

### Logging
- Use structured logging
- Include context IDs
- Support different levels
- Enable filtering
